# func_nth_largest ---------------------------------------------------------------
# DESC: Returns the n-th largest number from a vector.
# PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES: None
# FUNCTION DEPENDENCIES: None
# CREDIT: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25559778/producing-the-nth-largest-number-from-a-vector-in-r
# NOTES: Only works for vectors.
# ARGUMENTS:
  # 1. 'x' | (vector) Data to feed in
  # 2, 'n' | (integer) n-th largest number you want to take from the 'x'

# func_sample -----------------------------------------------------------
# DESC: Take a random sample of rows from a vector.
# PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES: None
# FUNCTION DEPENDENCIES: None
# CREDIT: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9390965/select-random-element-in-a-list-of-r
# NOTES: Builds on base `sample` function which does not work expectantly for vectors of length one.
# ARGUMENTS:
  # 1. 'x' | (vector) Data to feed in
  # 2, 'n' | (integer) Size of random sample you want to take from 'x'
  # 3. 'replacement' | (boolean) Whether you want to take a random sample with or without replacement
